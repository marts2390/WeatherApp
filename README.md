# Hello There!

Welcome to my test, I hope you like it!

It's built with Create React App so just run 'npm i' to install the packages, and then run 'npm run start' to start the development server, which will open a window in your browser.

Redux has been used for state and Typscript is used for typing and error management.

The UI is helped along by Material UI developed by the clever guys and gals at Google. 

Enjoy!
